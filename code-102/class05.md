# CSS

## Purpose

CSS allows you to add style and layout to your framework of data and information on your site. It allows you to make how the user views that data much more comfortable and clean.

## Linking

There are three ways to use CSS in your website. First by linking a css file containing all your css inside of it (preffered method). The second is internal CSS which is just css inside your HTML file. Finally there is inline, which is CSS inside your HTML elements.

## Example

To change all paragraph tags to red, something like this would be used:

`p {
    color: red;
}`
