# React and Forms

## Forms

### Whas is a 'Controlled Component'?

An imput form element whose value is controlled by React

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

I have no idea, it wasn't covered in the reading. Personally I would imagine it depends on what they are submitting. Their name? Wait till they are done? Typing a search? why not start presenting options right a way?

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

It looks like you have to set a value and have that value set the state of the value you are using to search.
