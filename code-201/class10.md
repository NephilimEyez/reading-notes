## Trouble Shooting JavaScript

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A syntax error is when you missed a key stroke, a parentheses, semicolon, something along those lines. A logic error is when you have written code inccorectly.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

I've had both. I put the wrong loop counter in the array field. I've missed closing curly brackets. I thought saying a variable on one side of or would carry it over to the other side of or. I thought you had to have an ELSE statement with an IF. Lots of things. Some I figured out on my own, some I had to ask about.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I recognize that syntax errors are usually a lot easier for someone else to see and logic errors can be a littel harder to find. Keeping that in mind, if I am struggling with something I suspect is a syntax error, I will always ask someone to look over the code and see if they can find the mistype.

## JavaScript Debugger

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

Its a built in tool in your browser that allows you to manipulate a sites JavaScript in real time to see the outcomes.

### Define what a breakpoint is.

A break point is a place where you want the code to stop running.

### What is the call stack?

Is it just the place where you invoke all your functions?
