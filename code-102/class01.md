### Growth Mindset

> “The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you.” ― B.B. King

Growth mindset to me is remembering and reminding yourself that everything worth doing takes ***effort, practice, repition, and determination***. Even if it doesn't come quickly, given enough of the afformentioned behavior it will, no matter what it is. No one is incapable of learning, it just may take longer.

**Reminders of how to stay in the growth mindset**
- If you are struggling ask for help
- It's ok to walk away and come back with a fresh set of eyes
- Remeber that if it's uncomfortable, you're learning
