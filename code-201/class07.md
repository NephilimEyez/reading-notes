# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain modeling

### Explain why we need domain modeling.

WOW, those first two paragraphs on domain modeling was enough to make me not want to read anymore. Glad I kept going. But what I essentially get from it is that it is used to not only contain a lot of code specific to the thing it's called on, but it can be used infinitely on infinite things of that type, whatever it may be. From people, to ratings.

## HTML Table Basics

### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Essentially they are great for data but not for content. They mess with screen readers in that regard. Styling them is much more complicated than a normal page. 

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.

`<table>` - Declaring a table is pretty obvious

`<th>` - Table header also very self explanitory

`<col>` - for color group, assigning a color to that group.

## Introducing constructors

### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

Ok so a constructor is an object and it makes my whole domain modeling thing wrong I think. So yay!

### How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

Are constructors just objects that are defined with variables? I am just not understanding the difference.
