# Operators and Loops

## Expressions

The big words say an expression is a unit of code that resolves to a value. Best I can figure trying to translate is it is something that ecould be stored in a variable.

## Loop

You would use a loop for anything that may have conditions or needs to be checked multiple times or until a desired response is recieved. It cleans up the code, makes it easier to read, understand and less resource intensive if you don't have to iterate through a 20 step if else statement.

## For loop

A for loop will execute till a predefined range is reached.

## While Loop

A while loop will run until it gets the input/result it is seeking.
