## Flow Control

Flow control is the order with which computer executes code. For example it looks for functions first before the rest of the scripts.

## Function

A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific function.

## Call a function

Simply writing a function makes it available to your code. You must call it in order to actually use it by placing its name in the code and any arguments it needs inside its parentheses. IE `grapeFruit(seedNumber)`.

## Parentheses

The parentheses as discussed above hold any value passed in to the function for its use. When creating a function you define how many inputs or what they are inside the parentheses.
