# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

_This section answers are from google, could not get the reading to work_

### What is functional programming?

A style of programming that uses functions for everything

### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

A pure function is a function that will give you the same answer to the same input each time and has no adverse side effects.

### What are the benefits of a pure function?

Easier to: Reason, combine, test, and debug

### What is immutability?

The inability to change a state after it's been assigned/created.

### What is Referential transparency?

Another form of a pure function perhaps? Google says it is referential if you can replace the function with it's output and the program would still work. Would that not be the case for almost all functions though?
