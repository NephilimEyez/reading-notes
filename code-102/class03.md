# Git

Git is a form of version control that saves snapshots of your work when you commit it so you can revert back if you did something you don't like or if you made an error you want to undo.

Coupled with a website like GitHub it allows multiple people to contribute to a project at the same time without creating errors.

There is sooo much more to git, I need to re-watch the lecture and fill this out further.

## Version Control

Version control is a simple way of saying it saves each version you make so you can revert or go back and view what you had done before without damaging the current release.

## Cloning

Cloning is the act of pulling a repository down from GitHub or similar cloud storing repositories.

## Tracking and Staging

You use `git status` to find out if files are currently staged and which may need to be staged.

You use `git add` to add files to the staging area. You follow this command with either the name of the files you specifically want to stage or a simple perios `.` to include all altered files.

## Snapshotting a file

Snapshotting occurs when you use the command `git commit` which saves and commits that version to memory.

## Pushing

We finally use `git push` to push the files to whatever app we are using to share our commits in the cloud, usually Github.
