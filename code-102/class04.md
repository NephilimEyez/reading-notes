# HTML

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**

It is the building blocks with which we build a site. The barebones information being shared to the user.

## The three main parts of HTML are:

- \<opening-tag> content \</closing-tag>

## Attributes

- **Attributes** are extra pieces of information added to a main tag.

## Semantic Element

- A semantic element is an element that clearly describes its meaning to the browser and developer.
