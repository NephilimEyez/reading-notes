# Images, Color, Text

## HTML Media

### What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

It would be used by a screen reader to tell a blind person what the picture of. It can tell a person who the picture does not load for what it was suppose to be.

### How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

use words and phrases that let people know it's an image, like "Image of penguins" or something descriptive.

### Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

You know I read about this in three places and the answers given did not make sense to me. "When the content is important but it's position is exact" I mean, that makes no sense to me. Reading on about it more in the provided links really didn't give me any clue. Maybe if you have a picture you want to move around the website and for some reason the img tag isn't enough? Really don't see a huge use case sorry. Code Snippets?

### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

GIF images are made up of little dots of color called pixels, so when you make the picture bigger you are just making the pixes bigger giving a grainy image the larger over it's intended size it gets. SVG files can be upscaled without the graininess.

### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

SVG it would allow you to make the picture any size you like without degrading the quality or making the file size extremely large.

## CSS

### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

background color changes the background color of the content while foreground will change the color of the text.

### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

Change the background color to something appealing, change the font color to a contrasting color. Add color to links, headers, maybe even the nav.

### What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

Ease of readability both at intended size and with scaling, commonness of the font.

### What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

Font size changes the size of the font.
Font weight changes the thickness of the font, similar to bold, but with options in between and beyond.
Font-style will let you add italics or other stylistic choices.

### Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

You could manipulate its padding or margin, depending where you wanted the space in relation to the content.
