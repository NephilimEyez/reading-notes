# Forms and JS Events

## HTML Forms

### Why are forms so important in web development

It is where the user interacts with the website inputing information that can make the website more interactive an tailored to them.

### When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

Keep it simple, only ask for the data you absolutely need. Keep it compact and easily readable.

### List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

> `<form>` - It is the form contaiiner
>`<label>` - Essentially the header fo the input
>`<input>` - here you define what kind of input it will be and this creates the field for the users response.
>`<textarea>` - For you to leave a message for the user. Not seeing it's overall use yet
>`<button>` - We all know what a button is, they can be set to send the forms data to the server

## JS

### How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

An event is the first domino in a chain. It waits for a specific user action, thhat action being pushing it over. It fires off and sends other things in motion.

### When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

You need to pass in the event you want to trigger and a function you want it to trigger

### Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

I really didn't understand this. Some sort of method, but the vocabulary description did not tell me what. Google says it tracks all events that occur on the page? Maybe giving you a single action to monitor events rather than dozens?

### What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

They work in opposite directions
