# Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio Content

### Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

Video an audio tags were not native to HTML and third party apps like flash had to be used to put them on the page.

### Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.

src is the url of the video while controls add default controls to pause or play the video.

### Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?

Incase a browser doesn't support video or it fails to load

### Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.

This is the strangest question. What are they doing? How does this help solidify anything. This is silly.

Video and audio are conjoined twins. They lived happily ever after.

## Grid

### How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

2 Deminsional control rather than 1.

### Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

Grid container is just like a flexbox container, the parent of the items will have its display set to grid.

Grid Item - It's the children of the container

Grid Line - Deviding lines

Grid Cell - A cell much like from tables that is made from your grid lines.

## Responsive Images

### Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

Optimal file size for slower connections

### Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

srcset allows you the browser to use a different image for a different size screen. sizes is the trigger for what size goes with which image.

### How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

Images are downloaded immediately upon hitting the site, javascript would change this and slow down the responsiveness of the site.
