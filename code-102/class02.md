# Markdown

Markdown is a lightwieght language that essentially lets you do what a word editor like microsoft word can do.

Markdown is a simple to use utility that lets you add useful stylization to pages that use it. Making their navigation and viewing simpler and more pleasureable for the end user. 

For example, placing a simple pound sign creates a heading:

\# Would make a level one heading as seen at the top of the page with the word Markdown, this is the largest heading, the more \# is used the smaller the heading using up to 6 \# in a row.

A single \* will make text *Italicized* while two \** will make text **bold**.

You can create a normal looking web-page link using simply the \[Description here] and \(link here) symbols.

You can also make an unordered list with the symbols \-, \*, and \+.
