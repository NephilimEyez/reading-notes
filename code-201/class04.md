# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML

### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

Anchor tags `<a>`

### The href attribute contains what information?

The hyperlink reference contains the link or location for the link to go. Web address, whatever term you perfer.

### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Don't just show it's link, give it context in it's description. Choose colors that are easy to read and make links easily recognizeable.

## CSS Layout

### What is meant by “normal flow”?

the document is read from top to bottom

### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

A block level element will take up the entire width of the screen and as much height as it needs for its content.

An inline element will continue on in the line it is without affecting the things around it with more than it's content size.

### ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static

### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

useful for precise layouts. Unchanging dynamics and views. It will always look the way you designed it. Good support.

### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Fixed is in relation to the browser while absolute is in relation to its parent.

## JS

### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

A Decleration is creating the function while an invocation is calling/using that function.

### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

A parameter is a variable INSIDE a function while an argument is a piece of data passed to the function when it is called.

## Misc

### Pair programming

I think the most obvious is it is pretty easy to miss your own typos. Working with someone, especially when you get stuck is a great second pair of eyes. It also helps with the creative flow, bouncing ideas off each other to get an idea of where to progress in the project.
